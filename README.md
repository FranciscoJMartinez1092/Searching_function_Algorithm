# Searching_function_Algorithm
Contains a search function and then a main function where an array is inserted into the search function and tested.

For the search function:
Precondition: The array segment starting at a[first] and containing size elements is sorted
 from smallest to largest. 
 Precondition: First is less than or equal to last
 Postcondition: The array segment starting at a[first]  has been 
 searched for the target up to the last element. If the target was present, then found is true, and location is set so 
 that target == a[location]. Otherwise, found is set to false. 
 Library facilities used: cstdlib (provides size_t from namespace std)
